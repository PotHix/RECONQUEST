# RECONQUEST

## INTRODUCTION

RECONQUEST is the game entry to Global Game Jam 2011.
It's a WebBase game made with JavaScript and Akihabara Library,
which uses the HTML5 Canvas.

IMPORTANT: This is a vintage-styled webgame and, therefore, has no
high-resolution assets or executable file. To play the game, run
the `game.html` file.

This game can also be played in:

## STORY

Due to continuous damage done to planet Earth by humanity, glaciers
start melting, revealing an ancient civilization hidden within the
ice. The very founder — and strongest being — of this civilization
now rises from the piles of snow  and sees a world taken by a race
that does more harm than good. The Titan then decides to put an
end to this situation and take back his planet, wiping off humanity
from it.
